                  I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Dan Srba
                  for over 12 years with two different firms, Grubb & Ellis and
                  Cresa NY. I have worked with Dan and his firm, not just for
                  industry experience and insight, but also to help create and
                  implement a staffing strategy. He has not only proven to be an
                  invaluable resource, but has become a good friend. It is rare
                  that you find such a capable, efficient partner to work with
                  and enjoy such a pleasant experience. I highly recommend Dan
                  Srba in any staffing and Human Resource capacity.

                  I have had the opportunity to work with Dan for close to 10
                  years. We have worked together as peers and he has also
                  reported to me. Dan is one of the best! He is an extremely
                  strong recruiter with great people sense and the ability to
                  unearth talent that would elude others. This ability is very
                  important in a market where top-talent is often difficult to
                  find and companies are relying on outside resources that can
                  deliver. Additionally, Dan is honest and always works hard to
                  make clients happy and to deliver results.
